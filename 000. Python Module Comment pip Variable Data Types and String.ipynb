    "- Python is a simple, interpreted, interactive, object oriented, open source and high level programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Features :\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Simple/General Purpose : \n",
    "- It's so easy to learn B'coz the syntax is similar to the english language and \n",
    "- Python syntax, allow developer to write program with fewer lines as compair to other programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Free and Open Source :\n",
    "- Freely available at the official website.\n",
    "- Open source, means source code is available to the public. So we can download it, use it as well as share it.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Example : regular expressions, uni testing, web browsers etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Expressive Language :\n",
    "- Single line of python code can do more than a single line of code in other language.\n",
    "- The fewer line of code, faster we can complete our project, easier to maintain and debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Object Oriented Language :\n",
    "- Python support OOL and concepts of classes, object and encapsulation etc.\n",
