    "# File Handling:\n",
    "- The Ram is volatile and all its contents are lost once a program terminate.\n",
    "- In order to persist the data forever, We use files.\n",
    "- A file is a data, stored in a storage device.\n",
    "- A python program can talk to the file after open it, read and write content from it.\n",
    "- In Python, files are treated in two modes as text or binary. \n",
    "- The file may be in the text or binary format, and each line of a file is ended with the special character.\n",
    "- File operation can be done in the following order.\n",
    "    - Open a file\n",
    "    - Read or write - Performing operation\n",
    "    - Close the file\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Open File:\n",
    "- Before performing any operation on the file like reading or writing, first, we have to open that file.\n",
    "- We should use Python’s inbuilt function open() but at the time of opening, \n",
    "- It accepts two arguments, file name and access mode \n",
    "- Syntax: f = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "- Where the following mode is supported:\n",
    "    -  r:  open an existing file for a read operation.\n",
    "    -  w:  open an existing file for a write operation. \n",
    "           If the file already contains some data then it will be overridden but \n",
    "           If the file is not present then it creates the file as well.\n",
    "    -  a:  open an existing file for append operation. It won’t override existing data.\n",
    "    - r+:  To read and write data into the file. The previous data in the file will be overridden.\n",
    "    - w+:  To write and read data. It will override existing data.\n",
    "    - a+:  To append and read data from the file. It won’t override existing data.\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Read File:\n",
    "- The open() function returns a file object, which has a read() method for reading the content of the file.\n",
    "- Syntax: f = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "          print(f.read())\n",
    "- We can also specify how many characters you want to return, ex: print(f.read(5))\n",
    "- We can return one line by using the readline() method, ex: print(f.readline())\n",
    "- If we use the readline() method two times, then we can get the first two lines of the file.\n",
    "- We can returns the list of the lines till the end of file(EOF) is reached by using the readlines() method, ex: print(f.readlines()).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Write File:\n",
    "- To write some text to a file, we need to open the file using the open method with one of the following access modes.\n",
    "- w: It will overwrite the file if any file exists. The file pointer is at the beginning of the file.\n",
    "- Syntax: f = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "          print(f.write(\"python\"))\n",
    "          \n",
    "- a: It will append the existing file. The file pointer is at the end of the file. It creates a new file if no file exists.\n",
    "- Syntax: f = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "          print(f.write(\"language\"))\n",
    "\n",
    "### Close File:\n",
    "- Once all the operations are done on the file, we must close file through close() method.\n",
    "- Syntax: f = open(\"demofile.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "          print(f.read())\n",
    "          f.close()   \n",
    "          \n",
    "### Creating a new file:\n",
    "- The new file can be created by using one of the following access modes with the function open().\n",
    "- x: it creates a new file with the specified name. It causes an error a file exists with the same name.\n",
    "- a: It creates a new file with the specified name if no such file exists. It appends the content to the file if the file already exists with the specified name.\n",
    "- w: It creates a new file with the specified name if no such file exists. It overwrites the existing file."
